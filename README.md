# Sampstar - Development in Progress

Welcome to the README of Sampstar! This project is an ambitious framework for SA-MP (San Andreas Multiplayer) written in Go, designed to empower developers with advanced features and improved performance.

Please note that Sampstar is currently in active development. While we strive to deliver a robust and reliable framework, there may be occasional bugs or incomplete features. We appreciate your understanding and patience as we work towards refining and expanding the capabilities of Sampstar.

## Project Description

Sampstar is a Go-based framework that serves as a port of the open-multiplayer project's source code. [Open-multiplayer](https://open.mp/), an open-source initiative, undertook the task of rewriting SA-MP and has made significant contributions to the SA-MP community. By building upon their codebase, Sampstar aims to continue the open-source legacy while providing enhanced functionality for SA-MP developers.
